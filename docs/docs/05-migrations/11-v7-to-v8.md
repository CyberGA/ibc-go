# Migrating from v7 to v8

This guide provides instructions for migrating to version `v8.0.0` of ibc-go.

There are four sections based on the four potential user groups of this document:

- [Migrating from v7 to v8](#migrating-from-v7-to-v8)
    - [Chains](#chains)
    - [IBC Apps](#ibc-apps)
    - [Relayers](#relayers)
    - [IBC Light Clients](#ibc-light-clients)

**Note:** ibc-go supports golang semantic versioning and therefore all imports must be updated on major version releases.

## Chains

The type of the `PortKeeper` field of the IBC keeper have been changed to `*portkeeper.Keeper`:

```diff
// Keeper defines each ICS keeper for IBC
type Keeper struct {
  // implements gRPC QueryServer interface
  types.QueryServer

  cdc codec.BinaryCodec

  ClientKeeper     clientkeeper.Keeper
  ConnectionKeeper connectionkeeper.Keeper
  ChannelKeeper    channelkeeper.Keeper
- PortKeeper       portkeeper.Keeper
+ PortKeeper       *portkeeper.Keeper
  Router           *porttypes.Router

  authority string
}
```

See [this PR](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/4703/files#diff-d18972debee5e64f16e40807b2ae112ddbe609504a93ea5e1c80a5d489c3a08a) for the changes required in `app.go`.

TODO: <https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/3505> (extra parameter added to transfer's `GenesisState`)

- You must pass the `authority` to the icahost keeper. ([#3520](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/3520)) See [diff](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/3520/files#diff-d18972debee5e64f16e40807b2ae112ddbe609504a93ea5e1c80a5d489c3a08a).

```diff
// app.go

	// ICA Host keeper
	app.ICAHostKeeper = icahostkeeper.NewKeeper(
		appCodec, keys[icahosttypes.StoreKey], app.GetSubspace(icahosttypes.SubModuleName),
		app.IBCFeeKeeper, // use ics29 fee as ics4Wrapper in middleware stack
		app.IBCKeeper.ChannelKeeper, &app.IBCKeeper.PortKeeper,
		app.AccountKeeper, scopedICAHostKeeper, app.MsgServiceRouter(),
+		authtypes.NewModuleAddress(govtypes.ModuleName).String(),
	)
```

- You must pass the `authority` to the icacontroller keeper. ([#3590](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/3590)) See [diff](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/3590/files#diff-d18972debee5e64f16e40807b2ae112ddbe609504a93ea5e1c80a5d489c3a08a).

```diff
// app.go

	// ICA Controller keeper
	app.ICAControllerKeeper = icacontrollerkeeper.NewKeeper(
		appCodec, keys[icacontrollertypes.StoreKey], app.GetSubspace(icacontrollertypes.SubModuleName),
		app.IBCFeeKeeper, // use ics29 fee as ics4Wrapper in middleware stack
		app.IBCKeeper.ChannelKeeper, &app.IBCKeeper.PortKeeper,
		scopedICAControllerKeeper, app.MsgServiceRouter(),
+		authtypes.NewModuleAddress(govtypes.ModuleName).String(),
	)
```

- You must pass the `authority` to the ibctransfer keeper. ([#3553](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/3553)) See [diff](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/3553/files#diff-d18972debee5e64f16e40807b2ae112ddbe609504a93ea5e1c80a5d489c3a08a).

```diff
// app.go

	// Create Transfer Keeper and pass IBCFeeKeeper as expected Channel and PortKeeper
	// since fee middleware will wrap the IBCKeeper for underlying application.
	app.TransferKeeper = ibctransferkeeper.NewKeeper(
		appCodec, keys[ibctransfertypes.StoreKey], app.GetSubspace(ibctransfertypes.ModuleName),
		app.IBCFeeKeeper, // ISC4 Wrapper: fee IBC middleware
		app.IBCKeeper.ChannelKeeper, &app.IBCKeeper.PortKeeper,
		app.AccountKeeper, app.BankKeeper, scopedTransferKeeper,
+		authtypes.NewModuleAddress(govtypes.ModuleName).String(),
	)
```

- You should pass the `authority` to the IBC keeper. ([#3640](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/3640) and [#3650](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/3650)) See [diff](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/3640/files#diff-d18972debee5e64f16e40807b2ae112ddbe609504a93ea5e1c80a5d489c3a08a).

```diff
// app.go

	// IBC Keepers
	app.IBCKeeper = ibckeeper.NewKeeper(
-       appCodec, keys[ibcexported.StoreKey], app.GetSubspace(ibcexported.ModuleName), app.StakingKeeper, app.UpgradeKeeper, scopedIBCKeeper,
+		appCodec, keys[ibcexported.StoreKey], app.GetSubspace(ibcexported.ModuleName), app.StakingKeeper, app.UpgradeKeeper, scopedIBCKeeper, authtypes.NewModuleAddress(govtypes.ModuleName).String(),
	)
```

### Params migration

Params are now self managed in the following submodules:

- ica/controller [#3590](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/3590)
- ica/host [#3520](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/3520)
- ibc/connection [#3650](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/3650)
- ibc/client [#3640](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/3640)
- ibc/transfer [#3553](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/3553)

Each module has a corresponding `MsgUpdateParams` message with a `Params` which can be specified in full to update the modules' `Params`.

Legacy params subspaces must still be initialised in app.go in order to successfully migrate from x/params to the new self-contained approach. See reference: <https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/main/testing/simapp/app.go#L1001-L1006>

### Governance V1 migration

Proposals have been migrated to [gov v1 messages](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.50/modules/gov#messages) ref: [#4620](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/4620). The proposal `ClientUpdateProposal` has been removed and replaced with `MsgRecoverClient` and the proposal `UpgradeProposal` has been removed and replaced with `MsgIBCSoftwareUpgrade`.

Ensure that the correct authority field is provided to the ibc keeper.

Remove legacy proposal registration from app.go ref: [#4602](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/4602).

Remove the 02-client proposal handler from the `govRouter`.

```diff
govRouter := govv1beta1.NewRouter()
govRouter.AddRoute(govtypes.RouterKey, govv1beta1.ProposalHandler).
  AddRoute(paramproposal.RouterKey, params.NewParamChangeProposalHandler(app.ParamsKeeper)).
- AddRoute(ibcclienttypes.RouterKey, ibcclient.NewClientProposalHandler(app.IBCKeeper.ClientKeeper))
```

Remove the UpgradeProposalHandler from the BasicModuleManager

```diff
app.BasicModuleManager = module.NewBasicManagerFromManager(
  app.ModuleManager,
  map[string]module.AppModuleBasic{
    genutiltypes.ModuleName: genutil.NewAppModuleBasic(genutiltypes.DefaultMessageValidator),
    govtypes.ModuleName: gov.NewAppModuleBasic(
      []govclient.ProposalHandler{
      paramsclient.ProposalHandler,
-     ibcclientclient.UpgradeProposalHandler,
    },
  ),
})
```

### Transfer migration

An automatic migration handler (TODO: add link after <https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/3104> is merged) is configured in the transfer module to set the [denomination metadata](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/95178ce036741ae6aa7af131fa9fccf3e13fff7a/proto/cosmos/bank/v1beta1/bank.proto#L96-L125) for the IBC denominations of all vouchers minted by the transfer module.

## IBC Apps

TODO: 

- <https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/3303>
- <https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/3967>

## Relayers

- Getter functions in `MsgChannelOpenInitResponse`, `MsgChannelOpenTryResponse`, `MsgTransferResponse`, `MsgRegisterInterchainAccountResponse` and `MsgSendTxResponse` have been removed. The fields can be accessed directly.
- `channeltypes.EventTypeTimeoutPacketOnClose` (where `channeltypes` is an import alias for `"github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v8/modules/core/04-channel"`) has been removed, since core IBC does not emit any event with this key.
- Attribute with key `counterparty_connection_id` has been removed from event with key `connectiontypes.EventTypeConnectionOpenInit` (where `connectiontypes` is an import alias for `"github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v8/modules/core/03-connection/types"`) and attribute with key `counterparty_channel_id` has been removed from event with key `channeltypes.EventTypeChannelOpenInit` (where `channeltypes` is an import alias for `"github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v8/modules/core/04-channel"`) since both (counterparty connection ID and counterparty channel ID) are empty on `ConnectionOpenInit` and `ChannelOpenInit` respectively. 

## IBC Light Clients

- No relevant changes were made in this release.
